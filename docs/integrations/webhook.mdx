# Webhooks & Serverless Functions Integrations

The webhook integration provides a way to call a predefined HTTP endpoint for
each new batch of data produced by a DNA stream.

This integration is well suited for the following tasks:

 - **build an indexer** using serverless technologies. You can invoke serverless
   functions such as, but not limited to, AWS Lambda, Supabase Functions,
   Cloudflare Functions, and Vercel Functions.
 - **send notifications** using the Discord or Telegram APIs.


## Configuration

Additionally to the [common configuration
options](/docs/integrations/configuration), the webhook integration provides
the following:

 - `--target-url`: URL where the stream data will be posted to.
 - `--header`: additional headers to send with the request. This flag can be
  repeated to specify multiple headers.
