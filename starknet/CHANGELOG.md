# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/), and
this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.6] - 2023-11-06

_Control the amount of data delivered to clients._

### Changed

 - Add the `include_transaction` and `include_receipt` options to
   `EventFilter`. These flags enable clients to control how much data is
   delivered to them by not including the transaction and/or receipt that
   emitted an event. Users that don't use this data should enable this flag
   to improve their indexer's performance.

## [1.1.5] - 2023-11-01

_Improve compatibility with Juno._

### Fixed

 - Fix a bug ingesting Starknet data in the presence of reverted transactions.
   Nodes such as Juno don't always include the revert reason (the field in the
   JSON-RPC is optional), which caused the DNA node to fail to ingest the
   transaction and block. This release allows the revert reason field to be
   missing.

## [1.1.4] - 2023-09-30

_Check usage quota._

### Added

 - Check clients usage quota while streaming by querying an external Quota
   service. The quota service checks if the user has exceeded their quota
   based on the team, client, and network name. Configure the quota service
   specifying the `--quota-server-address` flag.

## [1.1.3] - 2023-09-22

_Fix an issue with Starknet Mainnet deployments._

### Fixed

 - Update the MDBX size parameters to be in line with Starknet Mainnet. This
   fixes the ingestion stopped because of an MDBX "Full Map" error.

## [1.1.2] - 2023-09-04

_Add a new Status method to the gRPC service._

### Added

 - Add a `Status` method to the `Stream` gRPC service. This method is used to
   query the current service ingestion state.
 - Add `--address` CLI flag to change on which address the DNA service listens
 for connections. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:7171` for backward compatibility.

## [1.1.1] - 2023-08-18

_Improve compatibility with Starknet 0.12.1 and RPC 0.4.0._

### Changed

 - Update the Starknet client used. This ensures we have a better compatibility
   with RPC 0.4.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-08-08

_Add support for Starknet 0.12.1 and RPC 0.4.0._

### Changed

 - Connect to the Starknet node using RPC v0.4.0. You need to ensure your node
   supports this RPC version before deploying.
 - Add `execution_status` and `revert_reason` fields to the
   `TransactionReceipt` message. Notice that you need to resync the DNA service
   to have these fields populated.
 - Add the `include_reverted` field to `EventFilter`, `L2ToL1MessageFilter`,
   and `TransactionFilter` to request transactions that have been reverted.
   At the moment, these flags are ignored and the stream never includes data
   from reverted transactions.

## [1.0.4] - 2023-08-03

_Control maximum stream speed._

### Added

 - Add a new `--blocks-per-second-limit` flag to control how many blocks per
   second each stream is allowed to stream.
   This is needed to avoid that a few clients use all available bandwidth and
   reduce service quality for all other clients.
 - Add the `stream_bytes_sent` metric that tracks how much data is sent to each
   client.

## [1.0.3] - 2023-08-01

_Handle Madara more frequent blocks._

### Added

 - Add a new `--head-refresh-interval-ms` flag to control how often the server
   checks for new blocks from the Starknet node. Defaults to 3 seconds.

## [1.0.2] - 2023-07-27

_Improve logging and tracing._

### Changed

- Show a log message when starting and finishing the ingestion of a block.
- Reduce the amount of spans sent to OpenTemeletry by default, by changing the
  span level to `DEBUG`.

## [1.0.1] - 2023-07-24

_Start publishing versioned Docker images._
