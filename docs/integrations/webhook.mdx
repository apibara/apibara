# Webhooks & Serverless Functions Integrations

The webhook integration provides a way to call a predefined HTTP endpoint for
each new batch of data produced by a DNA stream.

This integration is well suited for the following tasks:

 - **build an indexer** using serverless technologies. You can invoke serverless
   functions such as, but not limited to, AWS Lambda, Supabase Functions,
   Cloudflare Functions, and Vercel Functions.
 - **send notifications** using the Discord or Telegram APIs.

### Installation

```
apibara plugins install sink-webhook
```

### Configuration

 - `targetUrl: string`: URL where the stream data will be posted to.
 - `raw: boolean`: if set to `true`, the payload will be the data returned by
   the transform function. Otherwise, wrap the data in JSON-object together
   with its cursors.
