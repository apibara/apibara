## [0.2.0] - 2023-09-16

_Introduce sink status gRPC service._

### Changed

 - The status server is now a gRPC service. This service returns the sink
   indexing status, the starting block, and the chain's current head block
   from the upstream DNA service. 
 - The status server now binds on a random port. This means it's easier to run
   multiple sinks at the same time.
