# MongoDB Integration

The MongoDB integration provides a way to mirror on-chain data to a MongoDB
collection of your choice. Data is automatically inserted as it's produced by
the chain, and it's invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.

 - The integration can be used to **populate a collection with data from one or
   more networks or smart contracts**.
 - Create powerful analytics with MongoDB pipelines.
 - Change how collections are queried without re-indexing.


## Configuration

Additionally to the [common configuration
options](/docs/integrations/configuration), the MongoDB integration provides
the following:

 - `--mongo-url`: the Mongo connection URL of your database.
 - `--db-name`: the target database name.
 - `--collection-name`: the target collection name.

## Collection schema

The transformation step is required to return an array of objects. Data is
converted to BSON and then written to the collection. The MongoDB integration
adds a `_cursor` column to each record so that data can be invalidated in case
of chain reorganizations.
