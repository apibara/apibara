# Configuring Integrations

Integrations provide several options to customize how they behave.
In this section we describe the options that all integrations have in common.
Notice that some options may not be available in the hosted version of
integrations. This is usually because the option is not needed or because
exposing it would represent a security issue.

**DNA Stream**

These options are related to the DNA stream the integration uses as its data source.

 - `--stream-url`: the DNA stream URL.
 - `--batch-size`: override the default batch size used to stream historical data.
 - `--max-message-size`: change the maximum message size allowed by gRPC.
 - `--auth-token`: authenticate using the provided token.
 - `--metadata`: add metadata to the DNA connection request.
 - `--starting-block`: start streaming from the block following the specified
   block number. If not specified, will start streaming from the genesis block.
 - `--starknet`: interpret the stream data as Starknet data.

**Data Finality**

You can choose what finality you need for your data. Only one of the following flags
can be specified.

 - `--finalized`: only accept blocks that have been finalized. Finalization
   status depends on the chain, but in general it means the blocks cannot be
   reorged.
 - `--accepted`: only accept accepted blocks. These are blocks that are part of
   the canonical chain. Notice that you will also receive finalized blocks that
   contain historical data.
 - `--pending`: accept pending blocks once the stream reaches the tip of the chain.

Notice that some integrations (for example, Parquet) are limited to finalized blocks.

**Filter & Transform**

These options are used to specify a data filter and transformation function.

 - `--filter`: the JSON-encoded filter to use. If it starts with `@`, it's
   interpreted as a path to a file.
 - `--transform`: path to a Javascript or Typescript file that contains the
   transformation function.
 - `--env-file`: a file containing the environment variables to load and expose
   to the transformation function.

**Persistence & Monitoring**

An integration's state can be persisted to an ETCD cluster, this ensures that
when the integration is restarted it will resume from where it left off in the
previous run. The ETCD cluster is also used as a synchronization mechanism to
run only one instance of the integration at the time.

 - `--persist-to-etcd`: URL to the ETCD server used to persist state.
 - `--sink-id`: unique identifier for this sink.
 - `--status-server-address`: address used to expose the status server. This
   service is used to check whether the integration is running or not.
