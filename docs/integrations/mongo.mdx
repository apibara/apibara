# MongoDB Integration

The MongoDB integration provides a way to mirror onchain data to a MongoDB
collection of your choice. Data is automatically inserted as it's produced by
the chain, and it's invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.

 - The integration can be used to **populate a collection with data from one or
   more networks or smart contracts**.
 - Create powerful analytics with MongoDB pipelines.
 - Change how collections are queried without re-indexing.


### Installation

```
apibara plugins install sink-mongo
```


### Configuration

 - `connectionString: string`: the Mongo connection URL of your database.
 - `database: string`: the target database name.
 - `collectionName: string`: the target collection name.


### Collection schema

The transformation step is required to return an array of objects. Data is
converted to BSON and then written to the collection. The MongoDB integration
adds a `_cursor` column to each record so that data can be invalidated in case
of chain reorganizations.
