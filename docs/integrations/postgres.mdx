# PostgreSQL Integration

The PostgreSQL integration is used to mirror onchain data to a Postgres
database. Data is automatically inserted as it's produced by the chain,
and it's invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.

 - This integration can be used to **populate SQL tables with data from one or
   more networks and smart contracts**.
 - Easily integrate with AI libraries such as Langchain.
 - Change how tables are joined or queried without re-indexing.

### Installation

```
apibara plugins install sink-postgres
```


### Configuration

 - `connectionString: string`: URL used to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
 - `tableName: string`: table where data will be inserted. The table must exist and
   it must have a schema compatible with the data returned by the transform
   step.
 - `noTls: boolean`: disable TLS when connecting to the server.
 - `tlsCertificate: string`: path to the PEM-formatted X509 TLS certificate.
 - `tlsDisableSystemRoots: boolean`: disable system root certificates.
 - `tlsAcceptInvalidCertificates: boolean`: accept invalid TLS certificates.
 - `tlsAcceptInvalidHostnames: boolean`: disable hostname validation.
 - `tlsUseSni: boolean`: use Server Name Identification (SNI).


### Table schema

The target table schema must be compatible with the data returned by the
transformation step.
Batch data is converted to Postgres records using the `json_populate_recordset`
function. Additionally, the PostgreSQL integration **requires a `_cursor`
column** in the table to keep track of each batch's cursor, so that data can be
invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.

### Provider-specific setup

#### Supabase

You have two options:

 - disable TLS by adding the `--no-tls=true` flag when running your indexer.
   **This is not recommended for production**.
 - download the SSL certificate from your Supabase dashboard (Settings =>
   Database) and convert it to PEM.

After downloading the `.crt` certificate from your dashboard, you will have a
`.crt` file in your download folder. This file will be named something like
`prod-ca-2021.pem`. Convert it to PEM using, for example, the `openssl` CLI tool.

```bash
openssl x509 -in prod-ca-2021.crt -out prod-ca-2021.pem -outform PEM
```

Use the `--tls-certificate` (or `sinkOptions.tlsCertificate` in your
script) flag to point to the PEM certificate path.

#### Neon

Use the provided connection string.
