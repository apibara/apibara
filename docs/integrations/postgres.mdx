# PostgreSQL Integration

The PostgreSQL integration is used to mirror on-chain data to a Postgres
database. Data is automatically inserted as it's produced by the chain,
and it's invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.

 - This integration can be used to **populate SQL tables with data from one or
   more networks and smart contracts**.
 - Easily integrate with AI libraries such as Langchain.
 - Change how tables are joined or queried without re-indexing.

## Configuration

Additionally to the [common configuration
options](/docs/integrations/configuration), the PostgreSQL integration provides
the following:

 - `--connection-string`: URL used to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
 - `--table-name`: table where data will be inserted. The table must exist and
   it must have a schema compatible with the data returned by the transform
   step.


## Table schema

The target table schema must be compatible with the data returned by the
transformation step.
Batch data is converted to Postgres records using the `json_populate_recordset`
function. Additionally, the PostgreSQL integration **requires a `_cursor`
column** in the table to keep track of each batch's cursor, so that data can be
invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.
