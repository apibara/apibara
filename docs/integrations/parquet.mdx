**Notice**: the Parquet integration is still in the early stage and subject to
change.

The Parquet integration is used to generate datasets containing on-chain data.
Parquet is the standard file format used by analytics applications such as:

 - The Pandas and Polars dataframe libraries for Python.
 - DuckDB, an in-process SQL OLAP database.


## Configuration

Additionally to the [common configuration
options](/docs/integrations/configuration), the Parquet integration provides
the following:

 - `--output-dir`: write the Parquet files to this directory.
 - `--parquet-batch-size`: each Parquet file contains data for the specified
   number of blocks.
